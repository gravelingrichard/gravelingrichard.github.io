<h2>My Approach</h2>
<p> My counselling training was in an approach called psychosynthesis*. This is a holistic approach that acknowledges the whole person i.e. the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions of experience. Psychosynthesis recognises that we can often have conflicting aspects of our selves, sometimes causing a great deal of distress. Accepting and processing these aspects can help develop a broader, more inclusive perspective, which can lead towards a greater sense of harmony and integration as an individual.
<br>
<br>
In my work, there is also an emphasis on what is emerging and what changes are seeking to take place in a person&rsquo;s life in order for them to live more closely aligned with deeper values and aspirations. Having experienced an existential crisis of my own some years ago, I am strongly aware of the inner conflict that can occur when we neglect our deeper yearnings. 
<br>
<br>
I often employ mindfulness approaches in my work . Mindfulness is a powerful tool to enable a greater capacity for self-awareness and self-reflection; this can increase the ability to 'step back' and let go of unhelpful patterns of thinking and feeling &#45; in turn this can help develop greater resilience and an enhanced sense of well-being.
