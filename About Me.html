<br>
<p id="indent">Life is not always a linear process - this has certainly been the case in my own life. I started out studying physics in my earlier years. However, my interest in the natural world later turned towards an interest in understanding people - in particular how to help others alleviate their suffering and find deeper sense of fulfilment. This led me to work for many years in the field of mental health, before training as a counsellor.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="indent">My Approach</h2>
<p id="indent"> My counselling training was in an approach called psychosynthesis. Broadly speaking, psychosynthesis views life as a journey of ongoing development. Diffiulties in the here and now can often be traced back to the past - exploring earlier experiences can therefore help to gain understanding and resolution to current problems.
<br>
There is also an emphasis on the future i.e. exploring what is emerging and what changes are seeking to take place in a person&rsquo;s life in order for them to live more closely aligned with deeper values and aspirations. Having experienced an existential crisis of my own some years ago, I am strongly aware of the inner conflict that can occur when we neglect our deeper yearnings.
<br>
<br>
I often employ mindfulness approaches in my work . Mindfulness is a powerful tool to enable a greater capacity for self-awareness and self-reflection  - this can lead to greater resilience and enhanced well-being, and can contribute greatly to the counselling process.
