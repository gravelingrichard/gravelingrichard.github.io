<p id="indent">If you&rsquo;re on this page, it may be that you, or someone you know, are experiencing difficulties or challenges in life. If this is the case then please read on to see what counselling may be able to offer you.</p>
<p id="indent">People come to counselling for many different reasons.  We might be experiencing anxiety or depression that significantly impact our ability to enjoy life. Or we may be struggling with a bereavement or loss , experiencing relationship issues or be seeking to change destructive behaviours, such as addiction. Alternatively, we can sometimes experience a crisis of meaning, where we might feel a lack of purpose and a sense that we are not living in accordance with our deeper values and aspirations.</p>
<p id="indent">Difficult experiences can often be understood to be a natural response to the challenging circumstances of life. Unfortunately, our society doesn&rsquo;t always allow space for these experiences to be present, and we can often be left feeling that they&rsquo;re wrong, or that we shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling them.</p>
<p id="indent">As a counsellor, my first priority is to provide a safe space, where you can feel free to bring your concerns without judgement. Providing this space allows us to explore your inner experience, supporting you to process your thoughts and feelings, and recognise their underlying causes. In turn, this can help you resolve conflicts, find a deeper sense of purpose and move forward in your life.</p>
<p id="indent">Please feel free to explore this site further for more information on me and how I practise.</p>
